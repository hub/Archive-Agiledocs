Contributing to Agile Toolkit Documentation Project
====

Agile Toolkit Documentation is a community initiative. If you see any parts which are lacking, require clarifications or translation, please contribute your time and effort to make this documentation more usable.


--------------

This is a list of requirements for every single component and widget of Agile Toolkit which it must meet in order to be bundled in official releases.

If requirements are not met, the component must remain as an add-on. Some suggestions:

 - must contain PSR compatible code
 - must have proper copyright header
 - must have person name who is responsible for the file.
 - must contain PHPDocs
 - header must contain URL to Live documentation
 - Live documentation must describe all methods and features
 - Live documentation must be accessible in less than 4 clicks from www site.
 - Must contain minimal test-scripts. Minimal test-script must execute all methods of the class. It's suggested to have a more intelligent test-cases
